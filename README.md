## Conclusion

We have started our project with Data preprocessing which included steps like checking for missing values and reducing the highly correlated features. Our second step involved Exploratory Data Analysis to get the more understanding of our dataset. This step included visualization of our analysis performed on the features. Our third step included the implementation part of different machine learning algorithms on the dataset. We trained and tested on different ML models.

At the end we chose Extra Tree Classifier with 97% accuracy, which was performing best on the validation dataset as comparison with other models on the basis of accuracy.

We got 94% accuracy on Test Set with our dataset trained on Extra Trees Classifier.
